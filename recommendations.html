            If I could eat one meal before I die, this would be it. These Christian fries right here. Why? Because this is a piece of heaven in your mouth. When you open the black box of heaven, it's like a bright light of purity consumes you (or it's just a mountain of cheese).<br><br>
            When you take your first bite, you have to take a little bit of everything first.

            This is not the typical taco that I eat. The tacos I usually eat don't have pinto beans and burnt cheese but man this taco is off the chain! They start off by putting a bunch of cheese on their grill and then they put a homemade tortilla on top and then flip it over.<br><br>
            The carne asada is so tender and juicy and the guacamole is so creamy. I usually am put off by pinto beans but these pinto beans on this taco made me a fan.<br><br>
            Make sure you get a bunch of sauce in the back corner of the restaurant. My favorite was the cilantro sauce but the chipotle sauce was delicious as well.<br><br>
            This taco might be more expensive than the other tacos that they have but they are definitely worth it. Try it and you'll be a fan as well.<br><br>-BUN

            I'll be honest. I could've put three different foods from Porto's on here but I decided on the potato balls. I've had them when coworkers brought them to work but it's a completely different story when you go to the store.<br><br>
            It's complete chaos inside with hundreds of people (no kidding) in line trying to pick out what they want. Most people buy boxes and boxes all the time and after trying these potato balls, you'll be wanting to stand in line again to buy boxes and boxes to go.<br><br>
            The potato balls are so soft on the outside and the filling inside is so tasty and just perfect. If you're not feeling the potato balls, try their guava pastry or their cheese rolls. You can close your eyes and pick one at random and you cannot go wrong. Or you can just buy boxes of all three and they'll be gone before you get back to your car.<br><br>

            In the summer of 2014, I was looking for Thai restaurants in San Diego in case I ever had a craving. I found this place, tried it once and never looked back. I also have this restaurant's Pad Thai on here because that's just how good this place is.<br><br>
            You can choose any protein you'd like. I usually get the chicken and with mild spicy. The yellow curry itself is sweeter than other types of curry. The rice that they serve the curry with is so perfectly cooked. The other stuff cooked with the curry (potatoes, veggies) are so delicious as well and complement the yellow curry.<br><br>
            One of the most awesome things is that they serve their food on paper plates. It may not appeal to some people but I think it's pretty cool.<br><br>
            One of San Diego's many hidden gems, this place has a mom and pop shop feel with all the family photos along the walls. There's a good chance you'll miss the restaurant if you walk by because it's not big, but boy does its food speak loud.<br><br>-BUN

            When there are food articles on the Internet that try to imitate your restaurant's signature dish, you know you have something special. And this place falls into that category perfectly.<br><br>
            Look up "San Tung recipe" online and you'll find many people who have been to this restaurant, tried their chicken wings, and liked it so much that they tried so hard to figure out what ingredients are in it and make it so good. And they write about it. But no matter how hard they try, it will <u>never</u> beat the original.<br><br>
            These wings are a gift from the chicken wing gods. I took a couple friends here for the first time and after one of them tried these wings, she said under her breath, "These are the best wings I've ever had." No kidding!<br><br>
            The crispiness on the outside, the tenderness on the inside combined with the sweet and spicy thick sauce. AMAZING. The sauce has a kick to it so be careful, BUT my sister can't handle spicy and she asks for more sauce to go so you really don't have an excuse. This place is spoken highly of so go try these when you're in the Bay!<br><br>-BUN

            This place is as authentic as you can get. Originally from south of the border, Tacos El Gordo blessed America by opening up restaurants in San Diego and Las Vegas (among other places).<br><br>
            The al pastor taco (aka adobada) is soft, juicy, tender, and just damn good. They cut it straight from the pole and put some of their sauce and other toppings. I don't know exactly what is in the green-ish they put, but I know that if they sold bottles of it, I would buy the hell out of it. They also make their own tortillas and also have vegetables that you can ask for that make the taco even better.<br><br>
            Just beware that parking is hard to find and tables are also hard to find because people hog them way before they even get their food. There's nothing more that I can say that so please just try these. They are as authentic as they come.<br><br>Also, I think these al pastor tacos are better than The Taco Stand's al pastor tacos. But of course that's just me and mostly every other person I've met.<br><br>-BUN

            I'll be honest. The burgers here are meh. The fries are okay and the onion rings are bleh. But the milkshakes at this place are bomb dot com. The milkshake itself is big enough to fill you up but I don't know if I would go all the way here just to get a milkshake so that's why I would just sit here and get a burger as well. There is almost always a line that goes out the door and there isn't much seating either. The good thing is that if you only want a milkshake, you can skip the line and go straight to the cashier inside.<br><br>
            The milkshake itself uses real ice cream and one of those fancy mixing machines that somehow uses some Harry Potter magic to create the creamy milkshake you see. Also, this isn't on the menu but you can order a Neopolitan-flavored milkshake! I don't remember exactly what it tasted like but I definitely know it was good.<br><br> 
            I recommend going somewhere else to eat and then swinging by Hodad's to get one of their delicious milkshakes. You might blow up because of a food coma but at least you'll blow up strawberry-flavored.<br><br>-BUN

            Full beefy rib dinner with a side of macaroni salad and fries. That's my go-to order. And if you like food at all, you should order that too. Is there a long wait at the restaurant? Yes, but it's, like they say themselves, #worththewait.<br><br>
            The full beefy rib dinner contains five giant ribs. The baby back ribs are delicious too but the beefy ribs are where it's at. You probably won't be able to eat all the ribs but they make lovely leftovers. If not, you can also order the half dinner which is just three ribs. The ribs themselves are so soft and so juicy. The BBQ sauce is so amazing.<br><br>

            This is one of two places that when I take my first bite, I close my eyes and tear a little. There's so much to say about this place but at the same time, I don't want to talk because I just want to enjoy my meal.<br><br>
            This restaurant has the second most reviews on Yelp. Surprising? No. Delicious? Yes. Do you need to try it ASAP? Yes a million.<br><br>-BUN

            Another place that I would go to with Jennifer when we were both back home. My childhood best friend Darren actually introduced me to this place. We were deciding between this place and a Korean restaurant across the street. We decided on here and I'm so glad we made that choice! This has become one of my favorite places to eat at when I'm back in the Bay Area.<br><br>
            The five spice chicken is so damn tasty. The skin on the top is crunchy but the meat is so tender and juicy. The noodles themselves have the perfect chewiness and the garlic makes it like 43525x better. The imperial rolls (you can order them with or without) are so yummy. And combine all of that with the sauce on top, it just creates perfection.<br><br>
            Another thing I love about Perilla is their service, specifically one waiter who is always working when I'm there. I don't know his name and the best way to describe him (I'm not trying to be offensive but I don't know how to distinguish him otherwise) is he's the chubby one with glasses. He talks in a soft but super nice voice and Jennifer and I absolutely adore him. Multiple reasons to enjoy going here!<br><br>-BUN

            Can anything be more authentic than ramen in Japan? Talk about going there with high expectations and then everything exceeds your expectations. This was probably my favorite meal in Japan: a small, simple ramen shop near Tokyo Tower that only had one worker.<br><br>
            It was a cold day in December and the broth was the perfect remedy. I got the spicy pork ramen so the soup had a little kick to it but not so much that you couldn't eat it. The pork was so soft and juicy, I remember closing my eyes and just cherishing it (and if you read my other recommendations, that rarely happens). It was just so tasty that sometimes I can think back to that meal and just taste the pork in my mouth. I remember eating it at the time and thinking to myself, "Yup, this is my favorite meal so far." and it stayed that way the entire trip.<br><br>
            The best part about this meal was that I was at the booth and I was watching the worker make my order. It was a show just watching him make the noodles, make the broth, and put all the toppings on. It definitely made the meal so much more enjoyable to see it being made and if I were to go back to Japan, I'd try my best to go back to this place to bring back the memories of that cold December day.<br><br>-BUN

            I'll be honest here: the picture that you see is not actually a picture of the cachete or the labio tacos. Then why did I post this picture? Because all the tacos they sell look <u>exactly</u> the same. Like no joke.<br><br>
            This place only sells beef tacos (cachete, labio, carne asada, cabeza) which is unique. Their tacos are $1.40 each (as of March 6, 2017) which is a great deal considering it's every day and not just a Taco Tuesday special. They chop them up in really small pieces which is a little weird because it seems a little mushy, but you can definitely still taste the flavor. They don't put a lot of stuff on their tacos, they don't get all fancy with the toppings. However, their sauces are very good. The cachete and labio tacos themselves are very juicy and you can taste the small fattiness that you don't taste in the carne asada and cabeza tacos.<br><br>
            I asked for a cup of water and they charged me $1.65 (that could've been another taco!) which I was so confused about. Maybe it's because they spoke all Spanish and I lost my three years of Spanish.<br><br>-BUN

            What time is it? Boba time! When I'm in San Diego, I always want to go to Boba Time. I'm not sure why because there are other Boba Time locations that are closer to me (Gardena, OC, Koreatown LA) and I could try something else while I'm in San Diego, but I just feel an attachment to it.<br><br>
            I usually alternate between two orders here: the avocado smoothie and the pistachio frappe. I think the pistachio frappe is more popular since it's on their top 10 drinks list, but who knows how they calculate that anyway. If I got one recently, I'll order the other one. I really can't go wrong with either of them and neither can you.<br><br>
            I like the avocado smoothie because it's super creamy and smooth. They also use avocados so sometimes you'll taste a bigger than normal chunk. The pistachio frappe also uses real pistachios and you'll taste the pistachio bits in there. The boba is sweet and chewy too. There's not much else to say other than it's my favorite boba place in Southern California. If there's Boba Time near me, then it's boba time.<br><br>-BUN

            You'll get stuffed just looking at a picture of this; it's humongous! This place has a very typical Southern California feel to it: outdoor seating moments away from the beach with the sun shining all around you in the summertime. Great isn't it? Oh, and they also have free coffee and bread outside while you wait. Yum!<br><br>
            Make sure you get the strawberries and the bananas as well, as they're not included in the price. To be honest, it's a little pricey but to be even more honest, you can split this with someone and it'll be more than enough. Because to be the most honest, a friend and I did that and she couldn't finish her half and I barely finished my half.<br><br>
            If you want a taste of Southern California, this is the epitome of that. You can try their blueberry pancakes and their eggs benedicts as well, but the stuffed french toast is where it's at.<br><br>-BUN

            This restaurant is so good, I have two different dishes on here. I couldn't decide which dish was better, so por que no los dos?<br><br>
            Most pad thai that I've eaten looks orange but not this place. The noodles are more brown looking, but it might be the best pad thai I've ever had. The noodles are so sweet and the small lime juice you squeeze on the top gives it a fresh twist. The peanuts give it a nice crunch and the chicken (or any other meat you desire) are a great complement. You can get different levels of spicy. For me, mild is the best because you still get a little kick but you don't reach for the water cup inhaling and exhaling after every bite.<br><br>
            So what if they come in paper plates? You should never judge a book by its cover, and that cannot be more true for Bahn Thai. If I go to Bahn Thai, I share the pad thai and the yellow curry. You can't really go wrong with either but go with a friend (or two or three) and share a bunch of these dishes because why try one when you can try two?<br><br>-BUN

            Tpumps. Old Town Sushi right next door. Or Tpumps while we ate at Old Town Sushi. Those were the good times. (You can even see the Tpumps in the back of that picture). A good friend Jennifer and I would do that every time we came back from college during break. That would be our go-to hangout meal. And then everything changed when the San Mateo Tpumps location closed. But then the San Francisco location opened and the world went back to normal (kinda).<br><br>
            My family and I love to go here when I visit home because it's a great environment. The staff are great and love to joke around. We usually come for dinner so we can get the dinner combination, which is a combination of three dishes on their selected menu for $22 or so, which is an absolute steal! I also recommend the double salmon roll because salmon = life.<br><br>
            The number one roll is a normal roll ingredient-wise, but they have a mountain of imitation crab meat on top and they also put some sriracha as well. It's a giant masterpiece that's very Instagram friendly, for those who want to post their pictures. The roll itself is very good but sometimes the crab meat can get overwhelming because of the mayonnaise but other than that, it's delicious. Too bad it's not one of the rolls included on the dinner combination menu.<br><br>-BUN

            My order: honey mango black milk tea, normal sweet, with boba and light ice. It's a sweet drink so if you don't like sweet, you can try other flavors or get it less sweet. In college, I met someone who worked at Tpumps at the time. I asked her what she recommended and she said this drink. I tried it once and I never looked back.<br><br> 
            When I went home during a school break in college, I went to Tpumps  days in a row, and one of those days I went twice in a day. And for the most part, I got the same thing every time. That's how much I love this place. And every time I go back home, I always try to go there when I go back home, except they opened a location in Pasadena so I'm pretty happy.<br><br>

            Hash House A Go Go is definitely a hyped up place. But it's one of those places you just have to go to so you can say you have been. There are always pictures of leaning towers of chicken and waffles and flapjacks the size of your face. The wait can be a little long. We went on the weekends and the wait was 45 minutes on a Saturday. My tip is to drop by and write down your name first then go explore the area. The Spruce St. Suspension Bridge is close by! <br><br> This flapjack was shared with four people and we barely finished. It was very fluffy which I appreciate in a flapjack. Honestly, just the sheer size was overwhelming. If you want something more hearty, I recommend the eggs benedict. It comes with huge biscuits sitting on top of a mountain of mashed taters. You can't go wrong with going here! <br><br>-HON

       I went here on a day trip to San Diego with my friends. It was the last few days I had in Southern California before I hda to move to Indiana for graduate school. I knew Indiana wasn't going to give me the tacos I grew up with so that was the only thing we wanted to eat that day. I also wanted to try places I've never been which is how we ended up at Puesto <br> <br> Puesto is a modern Mexican place located in a sleepy plaza by the beach. We found it on Yelp and decided to give it a try. There's a very aesthetic butterfly wing mural near the restaurant which is proably what attracts most customers into the plaza. We were a party of 6 annd they could only accomodate a table for 4 and bar seats for 2 which we didn't really mind. Those sitting at the bar didn't mind because they wanted to drink anyways. <br><br> We started with their Puesto Perfect Guacamole and quite honestly it was the best thing I had. The tacos here were meh. Their guac had so many flavors going on that complicmented each other really well. The perfect Puesto guac had avocado, spice from the chili, some cheese, and a mixture of sitrus zing! The cheese was unexpected but actually made it great! They also has fresh chips that went beautifully with the guac. <br><br>-HON

           We started with their Puesto Perfect Guacamole...it was AMAZING. There's so many flavors going on and somehow they mesh really well together. There's your expected avocado flavor, spice from the chili, some cheese, and a mixture of lime and orange zing! Definitely perfect! we had to keep asking for more chips ( which is super fresh too!) and literally licked the bowl clean. <br><br>-HON
